<img alt="Color System" src="./docs/assets/color_system.png">

GetIcons follow Google's material design for the UI. All the colors selected are based on the IconFinder Website.

<img alt="Premium Badge" src="./docs/assets/premium.png" align="left">
This badge denotes that the icon or the icon set is a premium icon. If an icon is a premium icon, then you cannot download the icon directly from the app.

## Domain Objects ðŸ“¦

```

## Navigation Graph

## Backend

The Iconfinder API is an HTTP JSON API and allows you to programmatically access resources on the service, such as icons, icon sets, categories, styles, authors, etc. The API is accessible on the api.iconfinder.com domain and always used over HTTPS. It accepts form-encoded request bodies, returns JSON-encoded responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes, authorization, and verbs.

## Limitations

- Due to the time limitation, could not implement error handling, few optimizations, designs etc.
- API is not clean and so, for some sets of data, fw entries are missing
- Searching for Icons, gives the list of Icons. This Icon object doesnot contain author detail or id. Due to which searching for individual icons doesnot show author details.
- Pagination of few pages are not implemented due to time constraint.
- Author's Icon set doesnot give icon set for the latest data. So most of the author details page is empty.
- Many more maybe that I dont remember now...
